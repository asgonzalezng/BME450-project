Title: Deep Learning-Based Glaucoma Detection from Retinal Fundus Images

Team: Cristina Macias (maciasm), Emmanuel Gichaba (egichaba), and Angelica Gonzalez (asgonzalezng)

Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative eye disease characterized by the damage of the optic nerve, leading to loss of vision and blindness. The optic nerve is a bundle of nerve fibers that connects the retina with the brain. The main risk factor of glaucoma is the increased intraocular pressure (IOP), which is a result of abnormal fluid build up in the eye’s drainage system [1].

Although multiple tests, such as tonometry to measure IOP or gonioscopy to determine aqueous humor drainage, fundoscopy, which examines the optic nerve and retina, is well considered to provide the earliest signs of glaucoma [2,3]. Diseased retinas have key morphological changes of the retina in what is termed cupping, where the size of the optic cup increases to the size of the optic disk due to the increased IOP [3]. This size difference found in a Fundoscopic retinal image is what ophthalmologists use to diagnose glaucoma.

Dataset: For this project, we used the PAPILA dataset collected at the Department of Ophthalmology of the Hospital General Universitario Reina Sofía, HGURS, (Murcia, Spain) between the years 2018 and 2020. The dataset contains 2576 × 1934 retinal fundus images of both eyes of all patients with a total of 480 files in JPEG format corresponding to 240 patients. We decided to use 80% of the images for training and the remaining 20% for testing and validation. [4]

Goal of the project: Create a machine learning algorithm that can clearly distinguish between optic disc/cup images  and provide a Glaucoma diagnosis using binary structures.
